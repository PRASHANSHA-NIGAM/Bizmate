Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Problem Statement:

Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to the volatility and complex patterns of stock prices. Traditional methods struggle to provide accurate predictions, making it difficult for investors to make informed decisions. A lack of real-time, automated tools for stock price forecasting further complicates investment strategies.
Solution:

The Stock Price Prediction model uses machine learning techniques to predict future stock prices based on historical data. By utilizing algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTMs, the model processes stock market data, including features like moving averages and volatility. This solution provides more accurate predictions, helping investors make informed, data-driven decisions.
Stock Price Prediction using ML
Tech Stack for Stock Price Predictor using Machine Learning:
Programming Languages: Python

Environment: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab (for cloud-based development)
Version Control: Git, GitHub (for code collaboration and version control)
Deployment: Flask for web deployment
Brief Approach to Build:
Data Collection:
Fetch historical stock price data using libraries like yfinance or APIs like Alpha Vantage or Quandl.
Collect additional features like market sentiment, economic indicators, or company fundamentals if needed.
Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data by handling missing values, normalizing the data, and transforming time-series data into a format suitable for machine learning.
Use features like moving averages, technical indicators, or historical trends.
Feature Engineering:
Generate new features based on time-series analysis (lag features, rolling averages, volatility, etc.).
Optionally, incorporate external factors such as news sentiment analysis for stock prediction enhancement.
Model Selection:
Start with traditional machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Experiment with deep learning models such as LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) for better handling of time-series data.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Train the models using training data, validate using cross-validation, and evaluate the model using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
Fine-tune the model using grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.
Prediction:
Predict future stock prices based on historical data, and test the model on unseen data.
Build a simple user interface (optional) to interact with the model and visualize stock predictions.
Deployment:
Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI as a web application or through a notebook for batch prediction.
